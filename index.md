## Research Interests

- Computational Communication

I am currently new to the field of computational communication, and I am still a novice. But I'm studying hard and trying to catch up.


## Research Training

- National College Student Innovation Training Project "Research on the Mechanism of Language Identity in the Revitalization of Rural Talents: A Case Study of Tongcun Town, Kaihua, Zhejiang"(December 2022 to April 2024)

- University-level Research Training Program (URP) "Research on Rural Reporting in Urban Media: A Case Study of the "Village" Channel of Beijing News(December 2021 to May 2023)

These are all scientific training that I did during my undergraduate studies. After entering the graduate level, I started a new research direction and received more specialized research training.
