<br>I like to see different scenery and experience different life through traveling, so far I have been to many cities with friends or alone. Traveling alone is also my favorite way. It allows me to do whatever I want and make new friends.

## Outdoor Trekking

<br>Outdoor trekking is a new hobby that I have developed in the past year. I enjoy the feeling of walking and the beautiful scenery after climbing the difficult mountains. My most recent hike in Shannan, Tibet, was a breakthrough for me.

<br>I like to use photography to record the beautiful scenery and interesting experiences in my life. However, my photography skills are still immature, and I hope to make continuous progress through practice.
